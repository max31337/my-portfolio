# Use the GitHub Pages dependency bundle (pins Jekyll + approved plugins)
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# NOTE: jekyll-feed, jekyll-seo-tag, jekyll-sitemap are already included and
# versionâ€‘pinned by github-pages. Listing them separately can trigger the
# "can't satisfy Gemfile dependencies" warning during Actions builds when
# the lock file was generated on Windows only. Keep Gemfile minimal.
