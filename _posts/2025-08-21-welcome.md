title: Shipping a fresh portfolio — and what I’ll write about
tags: [dotnet, tailwind, jekyll, career]

I finally took a weekend to build a clean, fast portfolio and a simple blog I’ll actually use.

What you can expect here:

- Practical .NET Core MVC tips (Razor, EF Core, MSSQL)
- Frontend notes with Tailwind and shadcn‑inspired patterns
- Project case studies and small architecture write‑ups
- Career logs: what I’m learning and shipping

Under the hood, this site is Jekyll + Tailwind (CDN) with a minimal, shadcn‑inspired UI, dark mode, and GitHub Pages for deployment.

If you’re hiring or want to collaborate, reach out—happy to chat.
